# Community-Detection-in-Complex-Networks

Final year project by Gavriel Shalem and Nati Birhuz, exploring advanced community detection algorithms in complex networks, aimed at uncovering and analyzing densely connected groups within various types of networks. This research project combines theoretical exploration with practical software tool development for network analysis.

### Community Detection in Complex Networks

# Overview

This project is a comprehensive research endeavor focused on the field of community detection within complex networks. As a pivotal aspect of network theory, community detection involves identifying groups within larger networks where nodes are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. This research aims to explore various algorithms and methodologies for effectively uncovering these communities, providing insights into their underlying structures and dynamics.

# Objectives

To understand the fundamental principles of complex networks and the significance of community structures within them.
To evaluate and implement cutting-edge algorithms for community detection, assessing their efficiency, accuracy, and applicability to different types of networks.
To develop a software tool that facilitates the analysis of complex networks, enabling users to identify and visualize communities within these networks.

# Team

This project is the culmination of a collaborative effort between Gavriel Shalem and Nati Birhuz, both senior students pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Azrieli College of Engineering. With a strong foundation in coding and a keen interest in applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios, this project serves as their final year project, showcasing their skills and knowledge in the field.

# Research Scope

The research encompasses a broad spectrum of networks, including social networks, biological networks, and technological networks, among others. By applying community detection algorithms to these diverse networks, the project seeks to uncover patterns and behaviors that are universal, as well as those that are unique to specific types of networks.

# Methodology

The project employs a rigorous methodology, beginning with a comprehensive review of existing literature on community detection. Following this, various algorithms will be implemented and tested on synthetic and real-world networks to evaluate their performance. The development process adheres to best coding practices, with an emphasis on modularity, readability, and robustness.
