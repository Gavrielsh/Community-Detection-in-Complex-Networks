# Facebook Pages Public Figure Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains information about public figure pages on Facebook. It includes two main files: `.nodes` and `.edges`, which represent the nodes and edges of a network graph, respectively. This document describes the structure and content of the `.edges` file.

## Edges File (`fb-pages-public-figure.edges`)

### Description
The `.edges` file contains information about the connections between the nodes in the network. Each row in the file corresponds to an edge, representing a relationship between two public figure pages.

### File Format
The file is a text file with space-separated values (SSV). Each row represents an edge with its associated data.

### Columns
- **Source Node ID (Column 0)**: The unique identifier of the source node in the edge.
- **Target Node ID (Column 1)**: The unique identifier of the target node in the edge.
- **Weight (Column 2)**: A numerical value representing the strength or weight of the connection between the two nodes.

### Example Rows
Here are the first few rows of the `.edges` file to illustrate its structure:

### Potential Uses
The data in the `.edges` file can be used for various analyses, including but not limited to:
- **Network Analysis**: Understanding the structure and connectivity of the network of public figures.
- **Community Detection**: Applying algorithms to detect communities or clusters of closely connected public figures.
- **Influence Analysis
